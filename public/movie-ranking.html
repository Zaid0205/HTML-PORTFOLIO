<h3>Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning: Part One</h3>
<p>
It’s not just visual nods. 
“Dead Reckoning” returns former IMF director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) to Ethan’s life with a new mission.
Kittridge informs Hunt that there’s essentially a rogue A.I. in the world that superpowers are battling to control.
The A.I. can be manipulated with a key split into two halves. 
One of those halves is about to be sold on the black market, and so Ethan and his team—including returning characters Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg)—have to not just intercept the key but discern its purpose.
The key only matters if IMF can figure out where and how to use it.

<h3>Extraction</h3>
<p>
Critic Robert Brian Taylor calls these movies part of "The Sad Action Hero canon."
Chris Hemsworth is its most notable new member. 
He plays Tyler Rake—a young boy's idea for an action hero name, but Hemsworth makes him seem almost like a real person.
He's a tremendous physical actor, possibly as good as Schwarzenegger and Stallone in their primes, but with more range. 
He's played a scheming male bimbo, a legendary computer hacker, a depressed mercenary, a 19th-century whaler, a cult leader, and the mighty Thor, all convincingly. 
He's got a bit of the young Sean Connery's self-aware swagger as well. 
But there's also a buried sadness to him, and that's what the "Extraction" films dig out.

<h3>Expendables</h3>
<p>
This has to be an intentional wink from Stallone and his contemporaries.
They know their days are not only numbered as action stars, but probably should have ended long ago.
It’s no longer just about old-school smashmouth displays of force in today’s actioners. 
Tech-savviness is the new black. 
As crazy as this sounds, this isn’t a hypothesis crafted from thin air; it’s actually the plot of “The Expendables III.”
